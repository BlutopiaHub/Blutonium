## required dependencies
### Use python 3.6.11 for Max compatibility 

``python3.6 -m pip install py-cpuinfo pg8000 speedtest-cli psutil discord.py\[voice] jishaku pytz requests``

## optional dependecies 

python3.6 -m pip install tflearn tensorflow==1.14.0

## Windows compatibility
This bot was built, tested, and is run on on Ubuntu 18.04/20.04
YOU WILL HAVE TO EDIT SOME FILES TO RUN THIS ON WINDOWS 10
I cannot guarantee this bot to be fully functional on windows 10
I will not be making a Windows 10 branch

## To set up the database
I use PostgreSQL for my database. The server must be running on the same computer as the bot. Right now you will have to try and wing it but soon i will update the sql.py file to automatically set up the database proprely.

I will also be creating a NO SQL branch in the near future.
